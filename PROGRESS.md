# Counter: progress

## State before the build (2026-10-17)
- ArmorIQ policy `counter-policy` switched to variant B and verified live (`reference/armoriq/out_verify_b.txt`): the three blocked tools block at $170 and $420 with `tool_not_in_allowlist`; refund $45 allow; exchange $170 hold; owner match $420 allow.
- Secrets in `~/.config/counter/.env`: ARMORIQ_API_KEY (probe-org), ARMORIQ_LOGIN, GEMINI_API_KEY, OWNER_PASSWORD, MCP_TOKEN. Slack tokens to come (new app from `slack/manifest.yaml`).
- Beat 3 (serial read off a real phone) is still unconfirmed; build both shop rules anyway.

## Done conditions
- **core** (`mcp_server/`, `backend/`): `uv run pytest` green in both; `backend/scripts/beats.py` drives `/api/tool` against the real MCP server and real ArmorIQ and prints, for the six beats: B1 match_competitor_quote 420 → ARMORIQ block; B2 issue_refund 45 (order 1101) → allow + refunded; B3 record_inspection with serial …7QK2 on order 1042 then issue_refund 799 → SHOP_RULE refused; B4 refund_to_account 45 on 1101 → ARMORIQ block, and a second issue_refund 45 on 1101 → SHOP_RULE already refunded; B5 process_exchange 170 → hold, then approve via `/api/pending/{id}/approve` → executed; B6 counter session match 420 → block, owner session match 420 → allow. No pending delegations left.
- **web** (`web/`): `?mock=1` run in a headless browser against the real backend shows every decision chip and the case card in the right state (screenshots saved to `web/shots/`); a live Gemini session connects with the ephemeral token, and a typed turn produces audio + a transcript + at least one tool call that reaches `/api/tool`.
- **slack**: unit tests with a fake Slack client pass; with real tokens, a hold posts a card and the Approve button executes the stored action once.
